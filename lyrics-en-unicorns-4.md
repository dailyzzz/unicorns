People of the unicorns did come again today
Bringing happiness and joy in every single way
Special kisses made our hearts beat together
Pleasant unicorns our brilliant weaving spider

The unicorns are fun they bring us so much pleasure
All the nations wait to see this magic treasure
Complete safety comes when we're all together
The unicorns make our peacefulness to last forever
We cherish them, abide with them and follow what they say

Happiness and joy has aided for peace and safety of the universe in every way
Every day is better, with this pleasant treasure, unto everyone as rainbow weather
Beautiful and pleasant feelings never fade away
Our eager hearts reflect the joy they made

The unicorns are fun they bring us so much pleasure
All the nations wait to see this magic treasure

And trust in them so much as they sure do work and play
