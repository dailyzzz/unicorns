[intro]

[verse]
Unicorn folks came to us today
Bringing joy and laughter in every way
Magical kisses made our hearts shine bright
Glorious unicorns weaving light

[pre-chorus]
Happiness spreads across the land
Their glowing light so warm and grand
Beautiful feelings never fade away
Our eager hearts reflect their ray

[chorus]
Unicorns bring us cheer so sweet
All nations wait this treasure to meet
True safety comes when we unite
Unicorns keep our peace so right

[verse]
Every day gets better with their glow
Like perfect weather their light does show
Pleasant feelings never turn to gray
Our thankful hearts will never stray

[pre-chorus]
Happiness spreads across the land
Their glowing light so warm and grand
Beautiful feelings never fade away
Our eager hearts reflect their ray

[chorus]
Unicorns bring us cheer so sweet
All nations wait this treasure to meet
True safety comes when we unite
Unicorns keep our peace so right

[chorus]
We love their ways and hold them dear
We trust their work and play sincere
True safety comes when we unite
Unicorns keep our peace so right
