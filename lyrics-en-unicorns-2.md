SONG 2: "The unicorns are fun they bring us so much pleasure"

[Intro]

[verse]
People of the unicorns did come to us today
Bringing joy and laughter in every single way
Special kisses made our hearts feel brighter
Pleasant unicorns our brilliant weaving spider

[chorus]
The unicorns are fun they bring us so much pleasure
All the nations wait to see this magic treasure
Complete safety comes when we're all together
Unicorns make our peace to last forever
We cherish them and follow what they do say

[verse]
Happiness and joy spread peace across the universe all the way
Every day is better with their splendid light to us as weather
Beautiful and pleasant feelings never fade away
Our eager hearts reflect the joy they made

[chorus]
The unicorns are fun they bring us so much pleasure
All the nations wait to see this magic treasure
Complete safety comes when we're all together
Unicorns our peace will last with us forever
We love their ways and cherish them in every way
And trust in them as they surely do work and play
